# Nodes - Rollout & Airdrop & Initial

## Prerequisites
#### Dependencies: What work must be completed before this part of the solution is actionable?
#### The tech design of the Token mechanism

## Problem

#### Opportunity: What are the needs of our target user groups?
#### A new opportunity to be an RPC nodes who will sever the Trust EVM network and will get paid by EVM Tokens. It's a staking buusiness so that many exchanges and groups want to be part of it

#### Target audience: Who is the target audience and why? 
#### BPs of EOS network and some groups who are running staking business such as Everstake

#### Strategic alignment: How does this problem align with our core strategic pillars?
#### Conducive to unifying the interests of all EOS nodes and contributors

## Solution

#### Solution name: How should we refer to this product opportunity?
#### Online and Offline recruitment

#### Purpose: Define the productâ€™s purpose briefly
#### Trust EVM need a ditributed RPC Network builded by multiple RPC nodes all over the world

#### Success definition: What are the top metrics for the product (up to 5) to define success?
#### Have more than 30 nodes to start the mainnet

#### Assumptions
#### N/A

#### Risks: What risks should be considered? https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/
#### 1. APR is not high enough to attract users to stake EVM tokens, so we may not have enough nodes to start the mainnet
#### 2. The delay of the development of token mechanism will also have a bad influence on the staking


#### Functionality
#### 1. APR estimation, staking workflow, and requirements of configurations for Nodes'  operationg hardwares need to be prepared - 1 weeks
#### 2. Offline recruitment with the BPs of EOS - 2 weeks
#### 3. Business development with groups like Everstake and Exchange - parallel with 2# in 2 weeks
#### 4. Airdrop the tokens to old BPs - 1 weeks
#### 5. Token sales to staking nodes - parallel with 2#,3# in 2 weeks
#### 6. A Website to identify ID, staking EVM tokens to regiter to be one nodes - 2 weeks
#### 7. Test all RPC nodes and pre-launch - 3 days
