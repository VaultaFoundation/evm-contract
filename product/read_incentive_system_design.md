# Read Incentive System

## Prerequisites
#### Dependencies:

## Problem
Write transactions in our system are processed by the EVM runtime. Thus it is simple to track and reward RPC node who served write transactions. 
However, read access is hard to track in the same way. In addition, we are trying to design a PoS system out of it.
Therefore, we need a special design to properly arrange duty, track operation and assign rewards.
