# Product brief of Token Economy Mechanism - Variable Simulation

## Prerequisites
#### Dependencies: What work must be completed before this part of the solution is actionable?
#### Task #13, #14

## Problem

#### Opportunity: What are the needs of our target user groups?
#### N/A
#### Target audience: Who is the target audience and why? 
#### The whole EVM team needs to know the simulation of token price, circulation and the influence by vesting time
#### Strategic alignment: How does this problem align with our core strategic pillars?
#### At the beginning of the project, controlling liquidity to realize the basic support for value capture for token price, to seek for the balance of inflation 

## Solution

#### Solution name: How should we refer to this product opportunity?
#### A excel with a math model to simulate possiblities of the bonding curve of EVM token, such as Staking APR, Token price, vesting influence, etc.
#### Purpose: Define the productâ€™s purpose briefly
#### To simulate the circulation of token in the market and the price of token based on the value capture model, with that to finalize the design of the token economy
#### Success definition: What are the top metrics for the product (up to 5) to define success?
#### Token based APR > 20% in bull market/ APR > 7.5% in bear market, moderate inflation, reduce circulation if market is terrible
#### Assumptions
#### N/A
#### Risks: What risks should be considered? https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/
#### The market is so terrible and EVM token needs to avoid launching Liquidity pool.
